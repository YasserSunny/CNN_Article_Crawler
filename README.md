# CNN_Article_Crawler

Create a PHP web application that accepts the URL of a cnn.com article page and spits out the following:
·         Headline
·         Photo (if one exists)
·         Story
Make sure to strip out all HTML tags as the story should be text-only. Also, adhere to the following rules:
·         must use class structures
·         must have constructor
·         it is ok to use native php stuff but no obvious 3rd party libraries please
·         Submit the code via Github (provide a link)
